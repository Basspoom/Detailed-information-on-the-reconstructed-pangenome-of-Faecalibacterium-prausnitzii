These documents provide detailed information on the reconstructed pan-genome of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii.
The file "orthmcl-cluster and sequence.fasta" provided the basic information of each orthogroup protein identified including their original F. prausnitzii strain, accession number and protein sequence.
Other files (tables) showed the number of each orthogroup (can be devied into pan protein, core protein, unique protein, accessory protein and single-copy core protein) in each genome of the 84 F. prausnitzii strain.
